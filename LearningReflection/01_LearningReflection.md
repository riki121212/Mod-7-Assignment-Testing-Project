> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
Testing GitLab was overall a positive experience. The application is easy to use.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
I reviewed the provided Login test case file to understand the expected structure, formatting, and level of detail. Then I followed the template to create test cases for the Register, Project, and Issue pages. After that, I wrote each test case step by step, making sure they were clear.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
I think Excel or Google Sheets would have been better to do this task

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
I used Visual Studio Code. It is lightweight, supports Markdown very well, and has useful extensions for formatting, Git integration, and file navigation.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
I encountered some confusion regarding how detailed the test steps should be. I solved this by reviewing the instructions more carefully and checking examples. Another challenge was understanding the correct GitLab URLs for issue pages and templates, which I solved by exploring the actual application and comparing it with the instructions.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
I did not face major issues using GitHub. I have used GitHub previously for school projects. The only challenge was ensuring the correct folder structure

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 

Most common skills required:

Manual testing

Test case creation

SQL and API testing

Selenium / Cypress automation

JavaScript, Python, or Java

CI/CD tools (Git, Jenkins, GitLab CI)

Understanding of Agile/Scrum

Defect tracking tools (Jira)

Version control (Git)

Attention to detail and analytical thinking

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 

Technical skills I would focus on:

Test automation (Selenium, Cypress, Robot Framework)

API testing (Postman, REST API basics)

Writing more structured and reusable test cases

CI/CD pipelines

SQL basics and backend validation

Soft skills to improve:

Better reporting and documentation

Test planning

Communication with developers and product owners


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-

Yes, this project was very helpful in putting theoretical testing knowledge into practice. Writing real test cases for a real web application helped reinforce concepts such as test design, identifying positive/negative scenarios, and structuring test suites. Completing the bug report also improved my understanding of how QA teams communicate issues to developers.
